For this project we decided to create a solver for the maze problem. The main point of solving a maze is to find such a pheromone filling of the maze that would minimize shortest paths to the target across the whole maze adjusted to hyperparameters that control the tradeoff between maximal number of iterations, minimal number of actors and minimal length of path. Such a design would allow us to change the workflow of the algorithm to solve the logistic problem from any point in the maze stochastically with different outcomes, i.e. without guarantee of the solution, but with certain confidence of finding such; with different thresholds for shortness of the paths (average or maximal); or with different computational requirements to  ease the solving for weaker hardwear. In this project we will solve simple rectangular mazes with guaranteed connection of all the cells within it. However afterwards our project can be expanded to more practical use, e.g. solving graphs by converting them to maze format, changing the dimensionality of the problem or simply adding other hyperparameters.

We decided that for this project the best algorithm is Ant Colony Optimization as it remains more effective in comparison to, for example, the Dijkstra algorithm, while remaining a flexible solution allowing us adjustments over the way the solution is being computed and over its quality.
